    "proTip": "To achieve the best results with the Primula Burke Deluxe Cold Brew Iced Coffee Maker, it's essential to pay attention to your coffee grind size and the amount of coffee used. A coarser grind is recommended for optimal extraction, as too fine a grind can lead to over-extraction and bitterness. Additionally, allow your coffee to brew overnight for a rich, smooth flavor that can be enjoyed cold or hot. Experimenting with different coffee types and brewing times can also enhance your cold brew experience, making it a delightful addition to your daily routine.",
